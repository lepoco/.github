              WHAT ARE PERSONAL DATA?
              <br />
            </strong>
            Personal data is all data that relates to an identified or
            identifiable person. These include, for example, your name, phone
            number or email address.

            <strong>
              HOW DOES OUR COMPANY OBTAIN DATA?
              <br />
            </strong>
            We obtain most of our customer data directly from them. We obtain
            some information from websites where we provide our products. e.g.
            on the official Microsoft Store website or WordPress.org.
          </p>

            <strong>
              PURPOSES OF PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA
              <br />
            </strong>
            The lepo.co company uses the personal data of its clients and
            application users only for the purpose of providing the service,
            analytics or introducing improvements in the operation of our
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              IS THE PROVISION OF PERSONAL DATA A STATUTORY OR CONTRACTUAL
              REQUIREMENT OR CONDITION OF CONCLUSION OF THE CONTRACT?
            </strong>
            <br />
            The use of our services, including the conclusion of a contract in
            the scope of our business, is fully voluntary, however, as an
            entrepreneur, lepo.co is obliged to perform the contract or keep
            records in a manner specified by law, including the use of your
            personal data. Providing personal data by you may be a contractual
            obligation or a condition for concluding a contract. Also for
            accounting or tax reasons, lepo.co has a legal obligation to process
            your data, which means that in this case providing data is a
            statutory requirement.
