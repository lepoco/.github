Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm **Leszek Pomianowski**, though you might know me better as **lepoco** on GitHub. This space is where I share my passion for .NET development, open-source contributions, and building tools that make developers' lives easier.

## My Mission

> "Code is not just about solving problems - it's about creating beautiful, intuitive experiences that developers actually want to use."

I believe that developer tools should be both powerful and beautiful. That's why I've dedicated my career to bridging the gap between functionality and aesthetics, particularly in the Windows development ecosystem.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is my way of sharing the journey - the successes, the challenges, and everything I learn along the way. You can expect posts about:

- **WPF UI Development** - Modern design patterns for Windows applications
- **Open Source Adventures** - Stories from building libraries used by thousands
- **Microsoft Collaborations** - Working with big tech on developer tools
- **MCP Servers** - Building AI-powered development tools
- **Community Building** - How open source creates amazing opportunities

## The Philosophy Behind My Work

Every project I work on is guided by a few core principles:

### Beauty Meets Function

Technology should be beautiful. Whether it's a UI library or a command-line tool, good design makes everything better.

### Community First

The best software is built by communities, not individuals. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference.

### Modern Standards

Why settle for outdated experiences when we can build something that feels native to today's platforms?

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm excited about several ongoing projects:

- **WPF UI 4.0** - The next evolution of modern Windows application design
- **MCP Ecosystem** - Building bridges between AI and developer workflows  
- **Microsoft Partnership** - Helping integrate community innovations into official frameworks
- **Community Growth** - Supporting the next generation of open-source contributors

## Join the Community

Development is better when we do it together. Here's how you can be part of the journey:

- **Follow on GitHub** - See what I'm building in real-time
- **Join Discussions** - Share ideas and feedback on projects
- **Contribute** - Every pull request makes the ecosystem stronger
- **Sponsor** - Support sustainable open-source development

## Stay Connected

This blog is just one way we can connect. You can also find me:

- **GitHub**: [@lepoco](https://github.com/lepoco) - Where the code lives
- **Sponsor**: [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/pomianowski) - Supporting the mission
- **Projects**: [lepo.co](https://lepo.co) - Professional support and services

## What's Next?

The future is incredibly exciting. We're at a unique moment where AI, modern design, and community collaboration are converging to create better developer experiences than ever before.

I'm committed to being part of that future - building tools that developers love, fostering inclusive communities, and proving that open source can compete with (and often beat) the biggest tech companies in the world.
