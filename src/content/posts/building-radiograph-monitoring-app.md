When I set out to create **Radiograph**, I had a simple vision: build a universal computer monitoring tool that was both powerful and beautiful. Today, with over 65,000 installations and a 4.7-star rating on the Microsoft Store, Radiograph has become a testament to what's possible when modern UI meets robust functionality.

## The Vision Behind Radiograph

Hardware monitoring applications have traditionally been functional but visually outdated. I wanted to create something different - a tool that system administrators, enthusiasts, and everyday users would actually enjoy using.

### Core Requirements
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltages, and performance metrics
- **Modern Interface** - Clean, intuitive design that matches Windows 11
- **Real-time Data** - Instant updates without performance impact
- **Reliable Backend** - Accurate hardware detection and monitoring
- **User-Friendly** - Accessible to both power users and beginners

## Technical Foundation

Radiograph is built on two key technologies that showcase the power of the .NET ecosystem:

### WPF UI Integration
Using my own WPF UI library, Radiograph features:
- **Modern Windows 11 Design** - Native Fluent Design elements
- **Automatic Theming** - Seamless light and dark mode support
- **Responsive Layout** - Adapts beautifully to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations** - Hardware-accelerated transitions and effects

### LibreHardwareMonitor Backend
For hardware monitoring capabilities, Radiograph leverages LibreHardwareMonitor:
- **Wide Hardware Support** - Intel/AMD CPUs, NVIDIA/AMD GPUs, various sensors
- **SMBIOS Integration** - Motherboard and system information (where I contributed)
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Efficient data collection with minimal overhead
- **Cross-platform Library** - .NET Framework and .NET Core support

## Key Features

### Temperature Monitoring
Track temperatures across all system components:
```csharp
// Example of temperature monitoring integration
public class TemperatureMonitor
{
    private Computer computer;
    
    public void Initialize()
    {
        computer = new Computer
        {
            IsCpuEnabled = true,
            IsGpuEnabled = true,
            IsMotherboardEnabled = true
        };
        
        computer.Open();
    }
    
    public void UpdateTemperatures()
    {
        computer.Accept(new UpdateVisitor());
        
        foreach (var hardware in computer.Hardware)
        {
            foreach (var sensor in hardware.Sensors)
            {
                if (sensor.SensorType == SensorType.Temperature)
                {
                    // Update UI with temperature data
                    UpdateTemperatureDisplay(sensor.Name, sensor.Value);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Performance Optimization
Hardware monitoring requires careful balance between accuracy and performance:

```csharp
// Efficient update strategy
public class OptimizedMonitoringService
{
    private Timer updateTimer;
    private readonly TimeSpan updateInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
    
    public void StartMonitoring()
    {
        updateTimer = new Timer(UpdateCallback, null, TimeSpan.Zero, updateInterval);
    }
    
    private void UpdateCallback(object state)
    {
        // Update only visible sensors to reduce CPU usage
        if (IsApplicationVisible())
        {
            UpdateVisibleSensors();
        }
        else
        {
            UpdateCriticalSensorsOnly();
        }
    }
}
```
