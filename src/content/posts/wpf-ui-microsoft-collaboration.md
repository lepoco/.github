I'm thrilled to share one of the most significant moments in my development career - the official collaboration between **WPF UI** and **Microsoft's WPF team** to integrate modern design elements into .NET 9.

## üéØ The Journey

What started as a personal project to bring modern Windows 11 design to WPF applications has evolved into something much bigger. WPF UI has grown from a simple library to a comprehensive solution used by thousands of developers worldwide.

### The Numbers Speak
- **8.8k+ GitHub stars** ‚≠ê
- **894 forks** üç¥
- **2.5k+ projects** using WPF UI
- **89 contributors** from the community
- **Used by Microsoft PowerToys** - one of GitHub's most popular developer tools

## ü§ù The Microsoft Partnership

In December 2023, I had the incredible honor to announce that Microsoft's WPF team reached out to collaborate on bringing WPF UI functionality directly into the .NET framework. This partnership aims to:

- Provide modern Windows 11 appearance natively in WPF
- Maintain the familiar WPF development experience
- Bridge traditional .NET frameworks with modern design principles
- Support the evolving needs of desktop application developers

## üöÄ What This Means

This collaboration represents more than just code integration - it's about:

### For Developers
- **Native modern controls** in WPF without additional dependencies
- **Seamless integration** with existing WPF projects
- **Official Microsoft support** for modern Windows design patterns
- **Continued innovation** in desktop application development

### For the Community
- **Open-source impact** being recognized at the highest level
- **Community-driven development** influencing major frameworks
- **Sustainable future** for WPF technology

## üí° Technical Highlights

WPF UI brings several key innovations to the table:

```xml
<ui:FluentWindow xmlns:ui="http://schemas.lepo.co/wpfui/2022/xaml">
  <StackPanel>
    <ui:TitleBar Title="Modern WPF App"/>
    <ui:Card Margin="8">
      <ui:Button Content="Modern Button" 
                 Icon="{ui:SymbolIcon Fluent24}" />
    </ui:Card>
  </StackPanel>
</ui:FluentWindow>
```

Key features include:
- **Modern Windows 11 controls** with Fluent Design
- **Dark/Light theme support** with system integration
- **Custom navigation** patterns
- **Advanced window management** including Snap Layouts
- **Mica and Acrylic** background effects

## üåü PowerToys Integration

One of the most rewarding aspects of this journey has been seeing WPF UI power **Microsoft PowerToys Run**. PowerToys is one of the most beloved developer tools on GitHub, and knowing that my library helps millions of developers daily is incredibly fulfilling.

## üîÆ Looking Forward

While some functionality will become part of core WPF, **WPF UI will continue to evolve**:
- Support for older .NET versions
- Advanced custom controls
- Experimental features and innovations
- Community-driven enhancements

## üôè Gratitude

This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the incredible support from:
- The amazing **WPF UI community** and contributors
- **Microsoft's WPF team**, especially for recognizing the value of community-driven innovation
- All the developers who trusted WPF UI in their projects
- Everyone who provided feedback, bug reports, and feature requests

## üöÄ Get Involved

Whether you're just starting with WPF or are a seasoned developer, I invite you to:
- Try **WPF UI** in your next project
- Contribute to the **open-source ecosystem**
- Join our community discussions
- Support through **GitHub Sponsors**

You can find WPF UI on [GitHub](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) and explore the documentation at [wpfui.lepo.co](https://wpfui.lepo.co).
