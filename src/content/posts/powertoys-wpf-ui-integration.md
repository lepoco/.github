One of the most satisfying moments in my development work has been seeing WPF UI become the foundation for Microsoft PowerToys Run. PowerToys is one of the most popular developer tools on GitHub, and knowing that my library helps millions of developers daily is still somewhat surreal.

## What PowerToys Run Does

PowerToys Run is a quick launcher for Windows that helps you find and launch applications, search files, perform calculations, and run web searches. It's part of Microsoft PowerToys, which is a collection of utilities for Windows power users.

The tool is designed around fast app launching by typing to find any installed application, file search across your system, built-in calculator functionality, direct web search capabilities, an extensible plugin ecosystem, and keyboard-first navigation for efficiency.
