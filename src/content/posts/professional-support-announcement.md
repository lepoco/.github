As WPF UI and my other projects have grown, I've gotten more requests for professional support from teams using them in production. Organizations often need faster response times, implementation guidance, or custom development help beyond what community support can provide.

So I'm launching professional support plans through lepo.co. These are designed for teams and organizations that need expert help with WPF UI, Radiograph, or other projects I maintain.

## Why Professional Support Matters

Community support works well for many situations, but sometimes you need more:

Priority response times when you're blocked on a critical issue. Expert guidance on implementation approaches and best practices. Custom solutions for specific business requirements. Training for development teams. SLA guarantees for enterprise environments.

## Support Options

I'm keeping this simple with three tiers:

**Priority Email Support** is perfect for small teams and startups. You get priority response to technical questions, implementation guidance, best practices consultation, and access to exclusive resources.

**Professional Support** adds video consultation sessions, code review and optimization, custom feature prioritization, and migration assistance.

## Who This Is For

This makes the most sense for software companies building Windows applications that need reliable, supported frameworks and expert guidance. Enterprise teams that require formal support agreements and predictable response times. Consulting firms delivering projects for multiple clients who need expert backup for complex implementations.

I'm not trying to replace community support or make the libraries themselves commercial. The core projects remain open-source and free. Community support continues through GitHub. This is for organizations that need something beyond what community support can provide.

## How It Works

The revenue from support plans directly funds continued development, which means faster feature releases, bug fixes, more comprehensive documentation, and enhanced community resources. But no features get locked behind paywalls, and the public documentation stays comprehensive.

Organizations using professional support have generally seen faster implementation - about 50% faster integration into existing projects, reduced learning curves for development teams, fewer bugs in production, and better performance through expert optimization.

## Getting Started

If you want to explore professional support options, you can visit lepo.co/support to see the available plans, schedule an initial consultation, and start receiving expert support. I aim to respond to initial contact within 24 hours, assess your specific needs, provide a tailored proposal, and ensure smooth onboarding with immediate value.

Beyond just support, lepo.co also offers custom development for bespoke components, integration services, performance optimization, and architecture consulting. There are also training services including team workshops, best practices training, code review sessions, and mentoring programs.

Professional support represents a way to create sustainable open-source development. By providing value to organizations that depend on these tools, we can ensure continued innovation and community growth while keeping the core libraries free and open for everyone.
