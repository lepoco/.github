    <h1>Professional Support</h1>
    <p>
      Sometimes teams need help with .NET stuff, WPF applications, or distributed systems. 
      I can help with that when my schedule allows.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What I Can Help With</h2>
    
    <h3>Technical Consulting</h3>
    <p>
      Architecture reviews for .NET applications, especially if you're dealing with microservices, 
      distributed systems, or modernizing legacy code. I can help figure out performance issues 
      and suggest better approaches based on what I've seen work (and not work).
    </p>
    
    <h3>Development Guidance</h3>
    <p>
      WPF UI stuff, modern .NET development, and working with technologies like Docker, RabbitMQ, 
      and gRPC. Code reviews when you need a second pair of eyes on something complex.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      Usually email for questions and advice, video calls for more complex discussions. 
      I get back to people within a day or two, depending on what else I have going on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I work remotely with teams mostly in Poland and Europe. For bigger projects, I might 
      be able to visit depending on where you are and what's involved.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What I Don't Do</h2>
    <p>
      I'm not available 24/7 or for emergency support. I don't take on full-time commitments 
      or exclusive contracts. For open-source project help, use GitHub Issues.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      Email me at <strong>support at lepo.co</strong> (replace "at" with @) with details about 
      what you're working on and what kind of help you need. I'll let you know if I can help 
      and when I might be available.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Not every project is a good fit for what I do, but I'll be honest about whether I can 
      actually help you or not.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Tech I Work With</h2>
    <p>
      .NET, C#, microservices, Docker, WPF, distributed systems, event sourcing, gRPC, 
      Playwright testing, and various other tools I've picked up over the years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is for specific technical guidance, not replacing your development team. The idea 
      is to help you avoid mistakes I've seen before and make better technical decisions.
