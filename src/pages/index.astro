    <h1 id="hello-there">Hello there!</h1>
    <p>I'm <strong><a href="https://github.com/pomianowski">Leszek Pomianowski</a></strong>, a .NET developer from Poland. I work on distributed systems and build tools that other developers seem to find useful.</p>
    
    <h2>What I do</h2>
    <p>I spend my time working with .NET applications - modernizing legacy systems, building microservices, and figuring out how to make things scale. I work with Docker, RabbitMQ, gRPC, and mess around with newer stuff like .NET 10, Aspire, and Marten. I also build WPF applications and contribute to open-source projects when I can.</p>
    
    <h2>Things I've Built</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui">WPF UI</a></strong> - Modern Windows controls for WPF that somehow ended up in Microsoft PowerToys and official WPF repo</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nh1p86h06cg">Radiograph</a></strong> - Hardware monitoring app that's been downloaded quite a bit</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/lepoco/mcp-camunda">Camunda MCP</a></strong> - Server for connecting AI tools to Camunda workflows, listed in Docker's official MCP hub</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If You Want to Chat</h2>
    <p>I'm interested in collaborating on cool projects, especially anything involving .NET architecture, distributed systems, or developer tools. I work with various teams on technical challenges and enjoy solving interesting problems.</p>
    
    <p>You can find my stuff on <a href="https://github.com/lepoco">GitHub</a>, support my work through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/pomianowski">GitHub Sponsors</a>, or <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a> if you want to chat about a project.</p>
