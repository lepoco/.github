    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Leszek Pomianowski, a .NET developer from Poland. I work on distributed systems 
      and like building tools that other developers find useful. I'm probably best known for 
      WPF UI, which somehow ended up being used by Microsoft PowerToys.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      I spend most of my time working with .NET applications - modernizing legacy systems, 
      building microservices, and figuring out how to make things scale. I work with Docker, 
      RabbitMQ, gRPC, event sourcing with Marten, and various other technologies that keep 
      distributed systems running.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I've been experimenting with .NET 10, Aspire for orchestration, and E2E testing with 
      Playwright. Recently I've been exploring AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor to 
      see how they can make development more efficient.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Projects I've Built</h2>
    
    <h3>WPF UI</h3>
    <p>
      A library that makes WPF applications look like they belong on modern Windows. It started 
      as a personal project because I was tired of WPF apps looking dated. It's been downloaded 
      quite a bit and is used by Microsoft PowerToys Run. Microsoft even worked with me to get 
      some of it into the official .NET framework.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Radiograph</h3>
    <p>
      A hardware monitoring app on the Microsoft Store. Built it with WPF UI and LibreHardwareMonitor 
      to monitor system temperatures and performance. It has a decent rating and is installed on 
      quite a few computers.
    </p>
    
    <h3>MCP Servers</h3>
    <p>
      I built two Model Context Protocol servers that ended up in Docker's official repository:
      one for Camunda process engines and another for OpenAPI specifications. They help AI assistants 
      work with business tools and API documentation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Day Job Stuff</h2>
    <p>
      I work on enterprise software - the kind that handles lots of users and has to keep running. 
      Mostly energy sector stuff, dealing with legacy systems that need to be modernized without 
      breaking everything. It involves a lot of distributed architecture and making sure things 
      scale properly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Other Things</h2>
    <p>
      I contribute to LibreHardwareMonitor when I can, mostly working on SMBIOS stuff. I maintain 
      some Azure DevOps extensions and help migrate old ASP.NET services to modern architectures 
      when needed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have a CS degree and some NVIDIA certification for NLP work. When I'm not coding, I play 
      games (big fan of The Witcher), design circuit boards as a hobby, and mess around with 
      Home Assistant for smart home automation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>If You Want to Collaborate</h2>
    <p>
      I'm interested in working on cool projects, especially if they involve .NET architecture, 
      distributed systems, or developer tools. I work with various teams on technical challenges 
      and enjoy solving interesting problems.
