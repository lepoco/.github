    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm <strong>Leszek Pomianowski</strong>, a passionate .NET developer and open-source enthusiast from Poland üáµüá±. 
      I'm the creator of <a href="https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPF UI</a>, 
      a modern UI library that brings Windows 11's Fluent Design to WPF applications.

    <h2>üöÄ What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      I specialize in creating beautiful, modern applications using .NET technologies. My focus is on bridging 
      the gap between traditional .NET frameworks and modern design principles, making it easier for developers 
      to create stunning Windows applications.
    </p>

      <li><strong>Open Source Impact</strong> - WPF UI has 8.8k+ stars, 894 forks, and is used by 2.5k+ projects</li>
