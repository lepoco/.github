    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm <strong>Leszek Pomianowski</strong>, a passionate .NET developer and open-source enthusiast from Poland. 
      I'm the creator of <a href="https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPF UI</a>, 
      a modern UI library that brings Windows 11's Fluent Design to WPF applications.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      I specialize in creating beautiful, modern applications using .NET technologies. My focus is on bridging 
      the gap between traditional .NET frameworks and modern design principles, making it easier for developers 
      to create stunning Windows applications.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microsoft Partnership</strong> - Collaborating with Microsoft's WPF team to integrate WPF UI functionality into .NET 9</li>
      <li><strong>PowerToys Integration</strong> - My WPF UI library powers Microsoft PowerToys Run, helping millions of developers</li>
      <li><strong>Open Source Impact</strong> - WPF UI has 8.8k+ stars, 894 forks, and is used by 2.5k+ projects</li>
      <li><strong>Official Docker MCP</strong> - Created two MCP servers published in Docker's official repository</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
    
    <h3>WPF UI</h3>
    <p>
      A comprehensive UI library that provides modern Windows 11 controls for WPF applications. 
      Features include navigation, theming, modern controls, and seamless integration with existing WPF projects.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Radiograph</h3>
    <p>
      A universal computer monitoring application available on the Microsoft Store with a 4.7/5 star rating. 
      Built using WPF UI and LibreHardwareMonitor, Radiograph monitors temperatures, power consumption, 
      hard drive health, and component performance. The application showcases the power of combining 
      modern UI design with robust hardware monitoring capabilities and is currently installed on over 65,000 computers.
    </p>
    
    <h3>MCP Servers</h3>
    <p>
      I've developed two Model Context Protocol servers that are officially published in Docker's MCP repository:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camunda MCP Server</strong> - Tools for interacting with Camunda 7 Community Edition Engine</li>
      <li><strong>OpenAPI MCP Server</strong> - Toolkit for fetching, validating, and generating code from OpenAPI/Swagger specs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>
    <p>
      Beyond my own projects, I actively contribute to the open-source community. I'm a contributor to 
      <a href="https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibreHardwareMonitor</a>, 
      where I've worked on SMBIOS enhancements and other hardware monitoring improvements. LibreHardwareMonitor is a 
      critical library for hardware monitoring applications, with over 7.3k stars and 246 contributors.
    </p>
